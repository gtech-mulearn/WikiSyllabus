# Module 1

## 1. Introduction to Economics

The term "Economics" is derived from the Greek word "IOKONOMIA," meaning household management. Adam Smith, known as the Father of Economics, introduced the seminal work "Wealth of Nations" in 1776. Economics examines how society and individuals allocate limited resources to meet unlimited wants. Business Economics, a specialized branch, applies economic concepts, methods, and theories to solve practical business problems and to make informed business decisions.

## 2. Problem of Scarcity

Scarcity refers to the condition where society's productive resources are insufficient to satisfy all human wants and needs. At any given time, only a limited amount of goods and services can be produced.

## 3. Basic Economic Problems

**Primary Concern: Scarcity of Resources (Limited Resources and Unlimited Wants)**

The basic economic problems, or central problems in an economy, are as follows:
1. The Problem of Allocation of Resources
2. The Problem of Fuller Utilization of Resources
3. The Problem of Growth of Resources
4. The Problem of Efficiency

### 3.1 The Problem of Allocation of Resources

The main concerns are:
1. **What to Produce?**
   - Produce according to the current needs of the economy.
2. **How to Produce?**
   - Use labour-intensive or capital-intensive methods, depending on price and availability.
3. **For Whom to Produce?**
   - Produce for society and households.

### 3.2 The Problem of Fuller Utilization of Resources

- Optimal usage of limited resources.
- Avoid wastage.
- Use scarce resources efficiently to maximize productive capacity.

### 3.3 The Problem of Growth of Resources

- Aim to improve the standard of living.
- Strive for economic growth.
- Achieve growth through technological advancements, which increase the resource limit.
- Technological advancements lead to greater economic growth.

### 3.4 The Problem of Efficiency

- Ensure efficient usage of resources.


## 4. Production Possibility Curve

- PPC is a curve which shows various combinations of 2 goods, which can be produced
with a given amount of resources and technology
- It is also known as production boundary or production frontier

#### Assumptions : 
1. Only 2 commodities are produced
2. Latest technology
3. Fuller utilisation of resources

#### Consider the example of two goods X and Y
| Production Possibility | Good X | Good Y |
|------------------------|--------|--------|
| P                      | 0      | 21     |
| A                      | 1      | 20     |
| B                      | 2      | 18     |
| C                      | 3      | 15     |
| D                      | 4      | 11     |
| E                      | 5      | 6      |
| P'                     | 6      | 0      |

![PPC graph](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/caf4803d-781d-4465-9c9b-b715794e3ec8)


- Any point on PPC shows fuller utilisation of
resources (P,A, B, C, D, E, P')
- Any point above or beyond PPC > point cannot be
attained, beyond the scope (G)
- Any point below the PPC shows the under
utilisation of resources (F)

#### Features of PPC

PPC is downward slopping curve and concave in
shape shows resources are transferred from one
use to other use, that’s why it is known as
transformation curve.

- **PPC slopes downward:** Production of one
good can be increased only after sacrificing
production of some quantity of the other
good.

- **PPC is concave to the origin:** A production
possibility curve is concave to the point of
origin because of increasing marginal rate of
transformation (MRT) or increasing marginal
opportunity cost (MOC).
MRT or MOC is the opportunity cost of
good X gained in terms of good Y given up.

- Concave shape of PPC means that slope of PPC
increase which implies that MRT increases. It means that for producing an additional unit of
a good, sacrifice of units of other good (i.e.
opportunity cost) goes on increasing.

      **Slope of PPC = ΔY / ΔX  
                     = Amount of Good Y lost / Amount of Good X gained  
                     = MRT or MOC**

#### Shifts in PPC

![PPC shift graph](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/e8f29bca-97bc-4545-9c47-ed818007a5d7)


With the discovery of new stock of resources or an advancement in technology, the productive
capacity of an economy increases.

- **PPC will shift to the right when:**
  - New stock of resources is discovered.
  - There is advancement in technology.

- **PPC will shift to the left when:**
  - Resources are destroyed because of national calamities like earthquakes, fires, wars, etc.
  - There is use of outdated technology.


## 5. Firms 
A firm is a for-profit business organization—such
as a corporation, limited liability company (LLC),
or partnership—that provides professional
services.

### Objectives of Firms
1. Profit maximisation
2. Sales maximisation
3. Increased market share/market dominance
4. Social/environmental concerns
5. Co-operatives – Welfare oriented

### Types of Firms
1. **Sole Proprietorship or Sole Trader** :  It is owned by one person, who is liable for all costs and obligations, and owns all assets.

2. **Partnership** : It is a business owned by two or more people; there is no limit to the number of
partners that can have a stake in ownership. A partnership's owners each are liable for all business obligations, and together they own everything that belongs to the business.

3. **Corporation** : Owners of a corporation are not liable for any costs, lawsuits, or other obligations of the business. A corporation may be owned by individuals or by a government. A firm that is owned by multiple people is often called a company.

4. **Financial Cooperative** : It is similar to a corporation in that its owners have limited liability, with the difference that its investors have a say in the company's operations


## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

**The law states that as a consumer consumes more and more units of a commodity the
marginal utility goes on diminishing.**

For example, a boy eats 5 ice creams. 1st ice cream has more satisfaction. After 2nd and 3rd satisfaction will start decreasing. It will eventually reach negative.

- **Utility** : The want satisfying capacity of a commodity is known as utility. It is
expressed in Utils. Utility is a cardinal concept i.e., it can be measured. Benham formulated the unit of measurement of utility as utils.

- **Total Utility ( TU)** : TU refers to the total satisfaction derived by the consumer from the
consumption of a given quantity of a commodity.

**TUn = MU1 + MU2 + .....+ Mun**

- **Marginal Utility (MU)** : MU refers to the additional utility derived by the consumer from the
consumption of an additional unit of a commodity

**MU = TU n – TU n-1**

**MU = d(TU) / d(Q)**

#### Assumptions
1. Commodify consumed as identical and standard size
2. No time gap between consumption
3. Consumers taste and preferences remain constant
4. Consumer is rational
5. Commodity should be normal, Not intoxicant like alcohol
6. Consumers income is constant

| No.of ice creams | TU      | MU     |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| 1                | 10      | 10     |
| 2                | 18      | 8      |
| 3                | 24      | 6      |
| 4                | 28      | 4      |
| 5                | 30      | 2      |
| 6                | 30      | 0      |
| 7                | 28      | -2     |

![DMU](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/8b58e308-2827-4b1e-9161-50e36366c66a)


- STAGE 1 > Increasing Returns
  - TU , MU increases at an increasing rate
- Stage 2 > Diminishing Returns
  - MU starts falling
  - TU increases at a diminishing rate
  - At the end of second stage , MU reaches zero
and TU reaches at its maximum (Point M )
- Stage 3 > Negative Returns
  - After point M, MU becomes negative
  - TU starts falling

- When Marginal utility is postive, Total Utility increases
- When Marginal utility is 0, Total utility is Maximum
- When Marginal utility is negave, Total Utility decreases

#### Consumer Equilibrium

According to DMU ,the consumer reaches
equilibrium when MU of last unit is equal to
price of the commodity

When he consumes only one commodity : 
**MU = PRICE**

When he consumes more than one commodity ( Consumes Goods X , Y , Z) - Law
of Equi-Marginal Utility : 
**MUx/Px = MUy/Py = MUz/Pz .......... MUn/Pn**

## 6. Demand

**Demand is the desire backed by the ability
and willingness to pay for a commodity.**

**Demand for a commodity : it refers to the quantity of a commodity demanded in the market in a given period of time at a given price.**

### Factors for Demand

1. **Price of the commodity**
   - Inverse relationship between demand and price.
   - Price Increases, Demand Decreases.

2. **Income of the consumer**
   - Positive relation between income and demand.

3. **Price of related goods**
   - If two goods are related, the price of one commodity will affect the demand for another commodity.
   - **Substitutable Commodities**: One can be substituted for the other. Example: Tea and coffee. If the price of tea increases, more people will drink coffee.
   - **Complementary Commodity**: Increase in price of X decreases demand of Y. Example: Petrol and Cars. If petrol price increases, demand for cars decreases.

4. **Taste and preferences of consumer**
5. **Advertisement**
6. **Climatic Conditions**
7. **Consumer Expectations**
8. **Population**


### Law of Demand
**The law states that other things remaining the same, price and quantity demanded of a commodity are inversely proportional**

#### Exceptions of Law of Demand
1. Veblen Goods - Luxury goods
2. Giffen Goods - Affordable goods that are not essential for daily life
3. Speculative goods - Assets that are purchased with the hope of selling them at a higher price in the near future
4. Necessities of life

#### Demand Schedule
| Price(per kg) | Quantity Demanded     | Reference Point     |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| 20                | 6      | A     |
| 30               | 5      | B      |
| 40                | 4      | C      |
| 50                | 3      | F      |

![Demand curve](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/f4c5ac54-d630-4d50-8c98-95eef9e45b12)


### 2 types of changes in Demand curve
1. **Movement: Change in Quantity Demanded**

    A movement along the demand curve is caused by a change in the price of the good, other things remaining constant. It is also called change in quantity demanded of the commodity.

    Movement along a demand curve can bring about:
    
    a. Expansion or Extension of demand refers to rise in demand due to fall in the price of the good.

    b. Contraction of demand refers to fall in demand due to rise in the price of the good.

    ![expansion contraction](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/286950af-ed73-4fb6-ac35-c172c45b0fa8)


2. **Shift: Change in Demand**

    A shift of the demand curve is caused by changes in factors other than price of the good. A change in factors causes shift of the demand curve. It is also called change in demand.

    A shift of the demand curve can bring about :

    a. Increase in Demand - It refers to more demand at a given price. The causes of increase in demand are: (i) Increase in the income of the consumers in case of normal goods. (ii) Decrease in the income of the consumers in case of inferior goods. (iii) Increase in the price of substitute goods. (iv) Fall in the price of complementary goods. (v) Consumer's taste becoming stronger in favour of the good

    b. Decrease in Demand - It refers to less demand at the given price. It occurs due to unfavourable changes in factors other than the price of the good.

    ![increase decease](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/53477a9a-0a7d-434c-8ca9-87691c66080f)

### Elasticity of Demand

It refers to the degree of responsiveness change in quantity demanded of a commodity due to change in price or any other factors.
3 types of Elasticity : Price, Income and Cross

**1. PRICE ELASTICITY**

It refers to the degree of responsiveness change in qty demanded of a commodity due to change in price.


Types of price elasticities of Demand :

**1. Perfectly elastic demand**
  - With a small change in price there would be an infinite change in qty demanded. It is an ideal and imaginary situation.
  - Elasticity = infinity

### Price elasticity of demand: Measurement using Percentage Method

    Td = Percentage change in Quatity demanded / Percentage change in price

    Td = (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q)

Percentage method is also called proportionate method. The absolute value of the coefficient of elasticity of demand ranges from zero to infinity.

##

**NUMERICALS ON PRICE ELASTICITY**

**Q1.** What should be the percentage change in price of a product if the
sale is to be increased by 50 percent and its price elasticity of demand is
2 ?

**Ans** : 

    Percentage change in quantity demanded = 50
    Price elasticity = 2
    Price Elasticity = Percentage change in Quatity demanded / Percentage change in price
    2 = x / 50
    x = 100

**Q2.** A company producing soft drink is selling its product for Rs. 22. It
sells 1000 units, and then increases the price to Rs.24. Now sales fall to
900 units. What is the price elasticity of soft drink? Is the demand elastic
or inelastic? Why?

**Ans** : 
      
    Initial price, P = 22
    New price = 24
    Initial quantity, Q = 1000 utils
    New quantity = 900 utils
    Change in price, ΔP = 24-22 = 2
    Change in quantity, ΔQ = 900-1000 = 100 utils
    Price Elasticity = (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q)
                     = (100/2) * (22/1000)
                     = 1.1

    Demand is elastic since value of price elasticity is greater than 1

**Q3.** When the price of a commodity falls by 2 per unit, its
quantity demanded increases by 10 units. Its price elasticity
of demand is 1. Calculate its quantity demanded at the
price before change which was 10 per unit.

**Ans** : 
    
    ΔP = -2
    ΔQ = 10
    Price Elasticity = 1
    P = 10

    Price Elasticity = (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q)
                   1 = (10/-2) * (10/x)
                   x = -50
                   Q = 50


**Q4.** A consumer spends 40 on a good at a price of 1 per unit
and 60 at a price of 2 per unit. What is the price elasticity of
demand? What kind of good it is? What shape its demand
curve will take?           

**Ans.**
      
      To determine the price elasticity of demand, we need to use the following formula:
      
      Ed = % ΔQ / % ΔP

      P1 = 1
      Q1 = 40

      P2 = 2
      Q2 = 60/2 = 30

      %ΔQ = Q2 - Q1 / Q1 * 100
          = 30-40/40 * 100
          = -25%
        
      %ΔP = P2 - P1 / P1 * 100
          = 2-1/1 * 100
          = 100%

      Ed = -25% / 100%
         = -0.25

##

**NUMERICALS ON CROSS ELASTICITY**

    Cross Elasticity = (ΔQx / ΔPy) * (Py / Qx)

**Q1.** A tea manufacturing company was able to sell 8000 kg of tea when
the price of coffee was Rs.70 per kg. Later they were able to sell 9000 kg
when the price of coffee became Rs.80 per kg. Calculate the cross
elasticity of demand for tea. Are the two commodities substitutes or
complements? Give reason.

**Ans.**

    ΔQx = Q1x - Qx
        = 9000 - 8000
        = 1000
      
    ΔPx = P1y - Py
        = 80 - 70
        = 10

     Qx = 8000
     Py = 70

     Cross Elasticity = (ΔQx / ΔPy) * (Py / Qx)
                      = (1000/10) * (70/8000)
                      = 0.875
      When the cross elasticity of demand is positive, it usually implies that the goods are substitutes. Substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other, so when the price of one increases, consumers tend to buy more of the other.
    
**Q2.** Suppose cross elasticity of demand between X and Y is 0.5. If there is
a 50 percent change in the price of Y, what will be the percentage change
in the quantity demanded of X?

**Ans:**
    
    Cross elasticity of demand = 0.5

    Percentage change in the price of commodity Y = 50% 

    Percentage change in quantity demanded of commodity X = ? 

    0.5 = Percentage change in quantity demanded of commodity X / 50 

    Percentage change in quantity demanded of commodity X = 50 x 0.5

    Percentage change in quantity demanded of commodity X = 25 %

**Q3.** Suppose the price of coffee rises from Rs. 4.50 per hundred grams to
Rs. 5 per hundred grams and as a result the consumer’s demand for tea
increases from 60 per hundred grams to 70 per hundred grams. Find the
cross elasticity of demand of tea and coffee.

**Ans:**

    Initial demand 60
    Final demand 70
    Initial Price = 4.5
    Final Price = 5

    ΔDtea = 70-60 = 10
    Dx = 6

    ΔPtea = 5-4.5 = 0.5
    Py = 4.5

    Cross elasticity of demand of tea for coffee = % change in demand of tea / % change in price of coffee
    
    Cross elasticity of demand of tea for coffee = (10/60) / (0.5/4.5) = 1.5 

## Supply

- Supply refers to the quantities of a commodity
which a seller offers for sale at a particular
price in a given period of time.
- It refers to the desired qty of commodity that
the seller offer for sale in the market.

### Factors affecting supply
1. Price of the commodity ( P rises SS rises)
2. Goals of the firm
3. Price of other commodities
4. Price of factors of production
5. State of technology
6. Government Taxation

### Law of Supply
**Other things remains constant, the quantity
supplied increases with rise in price of the
commodity and quantity supplied decreases
with fall in the price of the commodity**

### Supply Schedule
| Price(per kg) | Quantity Supplied     | Reference Point     |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| 1                | 5      | A     |
| 2               | 8      | B      |
| 3                | 12      | C      |

### Changes in Supply

1. Change in supply due to change in price –
Expansion and Contraction of supply –
Movement along supply curve

### Elasticity of Supply

It refers to the degree of responsiveness change
in qty supplied of a commodity due to change in
price or any other factors.

**1. Perfectly elastic supply**
  - With a small change in price there would be
an infinite change in qty supplied.
- Supply curve would be a horizontal straight
line parallel to x - axis
- Elastic Supply = infinity

**3. Unit elastic supply / Unitary elastic supply**
- With a given change in price there would be
an equal and proportionate change in qty
supplied for the commodity

**4. Elastic supply / More elastic supply**
- With a given change in price there would be a
more than proportionate change in qty
supplied of the commodity.
- Elastic Supply > 1

### Equilibrium Price

    Qd = Qs

    Price at which qty demanded of a commodity equals to the quantity supplied of the commodity

![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-09 at 11 38 14_3050c094](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/0aaff1a5-c113-4723-b94d-94f7d9f3912f)


#### Effects of changes in demand and supply on equilibrium price

**1. Increase in Demand**

When demand of a commodity increases, while supply remains constant, equilibrium price will
increase. At the same time, quantity sold and purchased will also increase.

**NUMERICALS ON DEMAND AND SUPPLY PROBLEM**

**Q1.** The demand function of a product is given as D = 60 - 2P and the
supply function S = 30 + 4P. Estimate equilibrium price and equilibrium
quantity. Also find the excess supply when Price equals Rs.6?

**Ans:**

    Given
    D = 60 - 2P
    S = 30 + 4P
    We need to find equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity
    When its equilibrium,
    Demand = Supply
    So that, 60 - 2P = 30 + 4P
    60-30 = 4P + 2P
    30 = 6P
    Equilibrium price (P) = 5
    Equilibrium quantity (Q) = 60 – 2 x 5 (substituting the value of P in demand function)
    = 50 units
    Equilibrium quantity (Q) = 30 + 4 x 5 (substituting the value of P in supply function)
    = 50 units
    Excess supply when Price equals Rs.6
    = 30 + 4 x 6 (substituting the value of 6 in supply function)
    = 54 units

## Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus

**Consumer Surplus**
- Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the consumers' willingness to pay
for a commodity and the actual price paid by them.
- A surplus occurs when the consumer’s willingness to pay for a product is greater than its
market price.
- Consumer surplus always increases as the price of a good falls and decreases as the price
of a good rises.


**Producer Surplus**
- Producer surplus is the difference between how much a person would be willing to accept
for given quantity of a good versus how much they can receive by selling the good at the
market price.
- The difference or surplus amount is the benefit the producer receives for selling the good
in the market

## Taxation 

- Taxation is the means by which a government or
the taxing authority imposes or levies a tax on its
citizens and business entities.
- Taxation refers to the practice of government
collecting money from its citizens to pay for
public services.
- A tax is a mandatory fee or financial charge levied
by any government on an individual or an
organization to collect revenue for public works
providing the best facilities and infrastructure.

## Deadweight Loss
- A deadweight loss is a cost to society created
by market inefficiency, which occurs
when supply and demand are out of
equilibrium.
- A deadweight loss is the irrecoverable
reduction in economic efficiency that occurs
when a free-market equilibrium is disturbed
by a market intervention or other shock to
supply and/or demand.
