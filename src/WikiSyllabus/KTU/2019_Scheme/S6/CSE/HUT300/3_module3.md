# MODULE 3

## 1. MARKET

Market is a term which is commonly used for a particular place or locality where goods are
bought and sold. According to Prof. Samuelson, “A market is a mechanism by which buyers and sellers interact to determine the price and quantity of a good or service.” 

Based on competition,
the market structure has been classified into two broad categories:
1. Perfectly competitive. (Perfect Competition)
2. Imperfectly competitive. (Monopoly, Monopolistic competition and Oligopoly)

## 1.1 PERFECT COMPETITION

Perfect competition is defined as a market
structure in which an individual firm
producing homogenous commodities cannot
influence the prevailing market price of the
product on its own.

Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by complete absence of rivalry among individual firms. (Price taker)

Features of Perfect Competition 
1. Very Large Number of Buyers and Sellers.
2. Homogeneous Product.
3. Free Entry or Exit of Firms.
4. Perfect Knowledge.
5. Perfect Mobility of Factors of Production.
6. Absence of Transportation Cost.

## 1.2. IMPERFECT COMPETITION

### MONOPOLY

- The word monopoly is derived from two Greek
words ‘mono’ means single and ‘polo’ means
to sell
- Monopoly is a market in which a single seller
sells a product which has no substitutes
- E.g. RBI , Rail transport

**Features of Monopoly**
1. Single seller
2. Restriction on entry
3. Price maker
4. No close substitutes
5. Price discrimination
6. No difference between firm and industry

**Dumping** : It means a monopolist sells his product at a higher price in the home market and lower price in the international market.

### Regulation of Monopoly
1. Promote competition. In some industries, it is possible to encourage competition, and
therefore there will be less need for government regulation.

2. Quality of service. If a firm has a monopoly over the provision of a particular service, it
may have little incentive to offer a good quality service. Government regulation can
ensure the firm meets minimum standards of service.

3. Prevent excess prices. Without government regulation, monopolies could put prices
above the competitive equilibrium. This would lead to allocative inefficiency and a
decline in consumer welfare

### Monopolistic Competition

- Monopolistic competition is a type of imperfect competition such that many producers sell
products that are differentiated from one another. 
- It is a market structure at which large number
of sellers dealing with differentiated commodities. 
- The main feature of monopolistic competition is Product Differentiation
- Product Differentiation means commodities marketed by each seller can be distinguished from
the products marketed by other seller in the form of size, shape, brand, color etc.
- The term Monopolistic comp was given by Prof. Edward H Chamberlin.

### Features of Monopolistic Competition
1. Freedom of entry and exit.
2. Firms produce differentiated products.
3. Firms have price inelastic demand; they are price makers because the good is highly
differentiated
4. Large number of sellers
5. Product Differentiation
6. Freedom for entry and exit
7. Advertisement and selling cost
8. Lack of Perfect Knowledge

### OLIGOPOLY

The word oligopoly is derived from two Greek
words ‘Oligo’ means Few and ‘Polo 'means to
sell

It is a market with few sellers dealing with
homogenous and differentiated commodities

In oligopoly one firm’s action will cause its
competitors to react. This shows that firms
has interdependence under oligopoly

### Features of Oligopoly
1. Few sellers
2. They are barriers for entry
3. Homogenous and Heterogenous commodities
4. Interdependence between firms
5. Independent Decision making

Kinked Demand Curve

If a firm increases its price, others will not come forward with a price increase of their
own and the firm may lose some customers to its rivals. If the firm cuts its price, others will
immediately follow suit to protect their own sales and the original firm will not gain more
sales. The kink is formed at the prevailing price because the segment of the demand curve
above this price is highly elastic and below it, less elastic. Hence the price under oligopoly
tends to be rigid or sticky.

### Collusive Oligopoly

Collusive oligopoly refers to the market situation where oligopolistic firms come to an
agreement and decide to collude. 

In order to avoid price wars and cut throat competition,
firms have some form of agreement among them in the matter of fixing price and output. 

The
agreement may be formal or tacit. In the case of a formal agreement, they may even make a
written agreement which may also provide for penalties to those who violate it.

Since formal or open agreements are illegal in most countries, they are generally of a
secretive nature. A cartel is a type of collusive oligopoly.

## Non - Price Competition

Non-price competition involves ways that firms
seek to increase sales and attract custom through
methods other than price.

Forms of Non – Price Competition:
- Loyalty card
- Subsidized delivery
- Advertising/brand loyalty
- After-sales service
- Coupons and free gifts

##

**1. PRODUCT PRICING**

By product pricing presents an opportunity to
set the right price for the by products of the
main core product so as to earn incremental
revenue.

The price of a product
depends upon:
1. Demand and supply.
2. Production cost.
3. Degree of competition.
4. Pricing strategy of competing firms.
5. Consumers purchasing power
6. Objective of the firm
7. Market Structure

##

**2. COST PLUS PRICING (MARKUP PRICING)**
Price is the sum of cost plus a profit margin. It involves
adding a mark up to the cost of goods to arrive at a selling price.

    Price = Average Cost + markup

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-|-|
|1. This method is simple since the price of a product can be easily derived using this strategy.| 1. It ignores the price charged by competitors.
|2. Any contractor will willingly accept this method for a contractual agreement with a
customer since this method assures a certain profit.| 2. Under this method the engineering department has no incentive to reduce costs.|
|3. In the case of price increase, manufactures can point out the increase in production costs as the reason.| 3. It ignores replacement costs.|

##

**3. TARGET RETURN PRICING**

It is a pricing method in which a formula is
used to calculate the price to be set for a
product to return a desired profit or rate of
return on investment assuming that a
particular quantity of the product is sold.

|Advantages|Disadvantages|

|3. Customers that are able to find a bargain in a product are likely to return to the firm in future.|3. It may trigger a price war and the new entrant may get wiped out.|

##
**5. PREDATORY PRICING**

It is a method of pricing in which a seller sets a
price so low that other suppliers cannot
compete and are forced to exit the market.

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-|-|
|1. Customers may benefit from low prices in the short period.| 1. It is hard to succeed since driving out all rival firms is difficult.|
|2. The price war triggered by predatory pricing may create a buyer’s market.| 2. It will result in huge loss of revenue at least in the short period.|
|3. Competition may provide a wider choice and new technologies to the customers.|3. It is illegal and can lead to court cases.
##
**6. GOING RATE PRICING**

It is when a business sets the price of its
product or service based on the market price.

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-|-|
|1. Uniform price in the market.| 1. Cost of production is ignored|
|2. Firms follow the price leader.| 2. It is difficult to match the production cost with the price that others are following.|
|3. No risk of price war| 3. Price is fixed by the dominant firm.|

##
**6. PRICE SKIMMING**

Price skimming is a product pricing strategy by
which a firm charges the highest initial price
that customers will pay and then lowers it
over time.


|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-|-|
|1. It provides a higher return on investment.| 1. It will work only if there are a large number of customers willing to get hold of the product even at a high price.
|2. It helps create and maintain brand image.| The high price will quickly attract competing firms to launch similar products.| 
|3. It helps firms to recover the cost of R&D.| 3. It works only in the short period.
|4. Early adopters help test new products and provide word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.| 4. It is suitable mainly for tech products and services.

##

**7. ADMINISTERED PRICING**

- The term administered pricing is used to denote the price charged by the monopolists.
- Administered prices are not fixed by the market mechanism
