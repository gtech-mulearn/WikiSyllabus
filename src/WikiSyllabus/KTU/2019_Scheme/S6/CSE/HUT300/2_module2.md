# MODULE 2

## 1. Production

It is the process of transformation of inputs into output

Input > Factors of Production

**Production Function**
      
      Q = f ( La, L , K , O )

There are 4 major factors of production
1. **Land(La)**
    - In economies it includes not only the surface area but also the vegetation, air, water, minerals etc around it.
    - The reward of land in production is rent
2. **Labour(L)**
    - It is the physical or mental effort that put in production. Labour is perishable because labour power cannot be storred
    - If a worker is not working one day, that days labour is lost forever
    - The reward of labour is wages
3. **Capital(K)**
    - It is the produced means of production
    - It can be in the form of machinery, equipment, building
    - Reward of capital is interest
    - Human capital is the stock of knowledge, skill, experience. Can be increased by
education and training
4. **Organisation / Entrepreneurship(O)**
    - Entrepreneur is the person who combines the services of other factors and organize production. Production involves risk and risk is taken by the entrepreneur.
    - Reward of entrepreneurship is profit

### Types of Production Function

**1. Law of Fixed Proportion**

*It is the arrangement where the quantities of
all inputs are varied in the same and equal
proportion. It happens in long run.*

**2. Law of Variable Proportion**

***The law of variable proportion states that as
more and more units of a variable factor are
applied to a given quantity of a fixed factor ,
the total product increase at an increasing
rate initially , but eventually it will increases at
a diminishing rate.***

*It is the arrangement where the quantity of a
single input varies, keeping the quantities of
other inputs constant . It happens in short run
due to unavailability of all inputs.*

**Total product of a factor(TP)**

It is the total physical output produced by employing a certain quantity of that
factor

For example:
Total product of labour means that when a certain amount of labour is
combined with fixed quantities of other factors, the total output produced is
the total product of labour

**Marginal product of a factor**

It is the addition to total product by employing one more unit of that factor.

For example, marginal product of labour means addition to TP(Total product)
when one more labour is employed


**Average product of the factor**

It is the output per unit of that factor employed

Its obtained by dividing the Total product by the number of units of that factor employed


### Assumptions of the Law
1. All units of the variable factor employed are equally efficient
2. Technology remains constant
3. The proportion of inputs can be varied

### Example

|No. of units of Labour | Total Product | Marginal Product | Average| Stages
|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----|
|1|8|8|8|Stage 1 (IRF)
|2|18|10|9|Stage 1 (IRF)
3|30|12|10|Stage 1 (IRF)
|INCREASING |RETURNS
4|40|10|10|Stage 2 (DRF)
5|45|5|9|Stage 2 (DRF)
6|48|3|8|Stage 2 (DRF)
7|49|1|7|Stage 2 (DRF)
8|49|0|6.1|Stage 2 (DRF)
DIMINISHING |RETURNS
9|45|-4|5|Stage 3 (NRF)
10|40|-5|4|Stage 3 (NRF)
NEGATIVE|RETURNS

- This example is of a farmer
- Farmer has 2 things, land and labour
- Here Land is a fixed factor
- Labour is a variable factor as it can be changed
- The farmer here decides to employ more and more labour
- So as more and more of one variable factor (Labour) is employed, the Marginal product is
decreasing
- Initially it was 8
- At the end it reached -5
- Similarly Total product is increasing and decreasing
- Initally its 8
- It peaked at 49
- Now its diminishing and reached 40

![production function](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/3bb7abfb-3ef8-4ff4-a587-527160f6c73e)


The diagram shows 3 stages

**Stage 1:**
- This is stage of increasing returns
- During this stage while MP (Marginal Product) increases, TP(Total Product) increases
at an increasing rate
- First stage continues till MP = AP(Average Product)

**Stage 2**
- This is the stage of diminishing returns
- MP decreases, which causes TP to increase at a diminishing rate
- Second stage ends when MP = 0
- When MP touches the x axis(MP = 0), TP curve has its highest point
- When MP = 0, TP is the maximum

**Stage 3**
- This is the stage of negative returns where MP becomes negative and TP starts
declining
- TP declines, TP curve comes down
- MP curve goes below the x axis



***Relation between MP and TP***

1. When MP increases, TP increases
2. When MP decreases but positive, TP increases at a decreasing rate
3. When MP becomes negative, TP declines


***Relation between MP and AP***
1. When MP > AP, AP increases
2. When MP = AP, AP is maximum
3. When MP < AP, AP decreases

## 2. Economies of Scale

It means advantages of large scale production
which help in reducing the average cost of
production.

|INTERNAL ECONOMIES          | EXTERNAL ECONOMIES
|----------------------------|------------------------------------
|***As a firm increases its scale of production, the firm enjoys several economies named as internal economies. Basically, internal economies are those which are special to each firm.***| ***External economies refer to all those benefits which accrue to all the firms operating in a given industry. Generally, these economies accrue due to the expansion of industry and other facilities expanded by the Government.***|
|1. *LABOUR ECONOMIES* : As the scale of production is expanded their accrue many labor economies, like new inventions, specialization, time saving production etc. A large firm employs large number of workers. Each worker is given the kind of job he is fit for. The HR manager evaluates the working efficiency of the labor if possible. Workers are skilled in their operations which save production, time and simultaneously encourage new ideas.          |1. *ECONOMIES OF CONCENTRATION* : As the number of firms in an area increases each firm enjoys some benefits like transport and communication, availability of raw materials, research and invention etc. Further financial assistance from banks and non-bank institutions easily accrue to firm. Special economic zones (SEZ) and export processing zones (EPZ) are cases in point.
|2. *TECHNICAL ECONOMIES* : Technical economies have their influence on the size of the firm. Generally, these economies accrue to large firms which enjoy higher efficiency from capital goods or machinery. Bigger firms having more resources at their disposal are able to install the most suitable machinery. Mechanization and adoption of more advanced technology are easier for a larger firm.       |2. *ECONOMIES OF INFORMATION* : When the number of firms in an industry expands they become mutually dependent on each other. In other words, they do not feel the need of independent research on individual basis. Many scientific and trade journals are published. These journals provide information to all the firms which relates to new markets, sources of raw materials, latest techniques of production etc.
|3. *MANAGERIAL ECONOMIES* : Managerial economies refer to production in managerial costs and proper management of large scale firm. Under this, work is divided and subdivided into different departments. Each department is headed by an expert who keeps a vigil on the minute details of his department. A small firm cannot afford this specialization. Experts are able to reduce the costs of production under their supervision. These also arise due to specialization of management and mechanization of managerial functions.      |3. *ECONOMIES OF VERTICAL DISINTEGRATION* : As an industry develops, firms divide and specialize in different production processes. For example, in the moped industry, some firms focus on rims, hubs, chains, pedals, and tires. This specialization can be horizontal, where each firm focuses on one item, or vertical, where each firm specializes in different items. One firm's waste materials become raw materials for another, reducing production costs for both. Selling firms earn from their waste, while buying firms save on raw material costs, leading to a decrease in the average cost of production.
|4. *MARKETING ECONOMIES* :  When the scale of production of a firm is increased, it enjoys numerous selling or marketing economies. In the marketing economies, we include advertisement economies, opening up of show rooms, appointment of sole distributors etc. Moreover, a large firm can conduct its own research to effect improvement in the quality of the product and to reduce the cost of production. The other economies of scale are advertising economies, economies from special arrangements with exclusive dealers.      |
|5. *ECONOMIES FOR TRANSPORT AND STORAGE* : A firm producing on large scale enjoys the economies of transport and storage. A big firm can have its own means of transportation to carry finished as well as raw material from one place to another. Moreover, big firms also enjoy the economies of storage facilities. The big firm also has its own storage and go down facilities. Therefore, these firms can store their products when prices are unfavorable in the market.       |


## 3. ISO-QUANT

- It is a curve which shows various combinations of two factor inputs which give the same level of output.
- ISO means equal and QUANT means quantity.
- It is also called Isoproduct curves and Equal product curves.

Combination of Labor and Capital | Units of Labor (L) | Units of Capital (K) | Output of Cloth(meters)
|-|-|-|-
|A |5 |9 |100
|B |10 |6 |100
|C |15 |4 |100
|D| 20| 3| 100

![isoquant](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/d195eac4-54ae-48ee-a1da-ef9a7b77b5d7)


### Properties of Iso-qoants
1. Isoquants are negatively sloped
2. Isoquants are convex to the origin
3. Two isoquants cannot cut each other
4. An isoquant lying above and to the right of
another isoquant represents a higher level of
output.
5. Isoquants need not be parallel

### Types of Iso-quants

1. **Linear Iso-quant curve :**
- perfect substitutability between the factors of
production.

![iso graph 1](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/c37d701d-241a-4f13-9afe-bc0b8a930c0d)


2. **Right Angled Iso-quant Curve :**

![iso graph 2](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/3567e740-2265-4a6b-b58e-b969999c456c)


## 4. ISO-COST

- An isocost line shows various combinations of labour and capital (two inputs) that can be
purchased for a given expenditure of the firm
- It shows various combinations of labour and capital that is available to the firm at the same
cost and at given prices of the inputs

![iso cost](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/2bccec1e-734a-4507-8191-aae755756e6d)


    Slope of AB = Price of Labor(w) / Price of Capital(r)

### Shift in Isocost line

![isocost1](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/b8c1fb9e-ea73-4543-a1a0-172eca4b369f)

![iso cost 2](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/531e99b9-1bf5-4706-bf40-e12e21789689)


## 5. Producer's Equilibrium / Least cost combination

The point of least-cost combination of factors
for a given level of output is where the
isoquant curve is tangent to an iso-cost line.

![producer equilibrium](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/3cc369af-6f6c-4298-8d45-c20da492b87a)


- It is attained at that point where the isoquant is tangent to the isocost line
- Here isoquant is tangent to isocost at E, Which makes E the equilibrium point
- Q2 Isoquant will be produced with the least cost

## 6. Expansion Path

- Expansion path is a line connecting optimal input combinations as the scale of production
expands
- We can obtain the expansion path by joining the point of tangency between isoquants and
isocost lines of a firm

![extension path](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/b6da864e-c196-431e-bf66-643798c2c8cb)


## 7. Cobb - Douglas Production Function

Cobb douglas production function is widely used to represent the technological
relationship between the amounts of 2 inputs, particularly capital and labour and the
amount of output that can be produced

    Q = A * L^α * K^β

    Q = Total output
    L = Labour
    K = Capital
    A = Total factor productivity
    α and β are the output elasticities of labour and capital respectively

    α + β = 1 >> Constant Returns to Scale
    α + β > 1 >> Increasing Returns to Scale
    α + β > 1 >> Decreasing Returns to Scale

## 
**NUMERICALS ON COBB DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION**

**Q1.** In the production function Q = 2 L^1/2 K^1/2
 if L=36 how many units of
capital are needed to produce 60 units of output?**

**Ans:**

    Q = A * L^α * K^β

    Q = 2 * L^1/2 * K^1/2
    Given L = 36
    Given Total Output Q = 60
    Subbing the values
    60 = 2 ∗ 36^1/2 * K^1/2
    60 = 2 ∗ 6 ∗ K^1/2
    60 = 12 ∗ K^1/2
    5 = K^1/2
    25 = K
    So the capital needed is 25

**Q2.** Given below are the production function of firm A, Q = 2 K^0.25 L^0.75
The firm uses 5 units of labour (L) and 5 units of capital (K). Calculate the output. If we reduce L by 10%, how much K would be increased to
produce the same output.

**Ans:**

    Given Labour L = 5
    Capital K = 5
    Q = A * L^α * K^β
    Q = 2 ∗ 5^0.25 ∗ 5^0.75
    Q = 2 x 5
    Q = 10

    Reducing L by 10%
    5 * 0.9 = 4.5
    To produce the same output, 
    10 = K^0.25 * 4.5^0.75
    K = 6.86 units

**Q3.** In a production function, Q = 2 * L^1/2 * K^1/2
. If L= 36
1. How many units of capital are needed to produce 60 units of output
2. Determine the percentage increase in output if labour is increased by 10% assuming capital is held constant

**Ans:**

    1.When Q = 60 
      L = 36
      60 = 2 ∗ 36^1/2 * K^1/2
      60 = 2 ∗ 6 ∗ K^1/2
      5 = K^1/2
      K = 25

    2. Labour increased by 10%
        L = 36
        L = L 1.1 = 36 1.1 = 39.6
        Capital is constant, lets take it as 25
        2 * 36^1/2 * 25^1/2 = 60
        2 * 39.6^1/2 * 25^1/2 = 2 * 6.29 * 5 = 62.9

        Percentage increase = (Q2 - Q1)/Q1 * 100

        (62.9 - 60)/60 * 100
        = (2.9) / 60 * 100
        = 4.83
        = 5%

        5% increase in output

**Q4.** Derive the marginal product from the Cobb-Douglas production function.

**Ans:**

    Marginal product of Labor, 
    MPL = dQ/dL 
        = A * α * L^α-1 * K^β
        = α/L (A * L^α * K^β) 
        = α (Q/L) 
        = α (Average Product of Labor) or α (APL)

    Marginal product of Capital, 
    MPK = dQ/dK 
        = A * β * L^α * K^β-1
        = β/K (A * L^α * K^β) 
        = β (Q/K) 
        = β (Average Product of Capital) or β (APK)

**Q5.** Suppose that the production function is given as Q = A * L^3/4 * K^1/4

(a) Find out the output when K = 20 and L = 30

(b) Find the marginal product of labor when K = 20 and L = 30.

(c) Find the average product of Capital when K = 20 and L = 30.

(d) Find the number of units of capital required to produce 100 units of output if L = 40.

**Ans:**
(a)

    Q = 4 X 30^3/4 X 20^1/4
      = 4 X 12.8 X 2.11
      = 108.03

(b)

    MPL = 4 X 3⁄4(30^-1/4) X 20^1/4
        = 4 X 0.42 X 2.11
        = 3.54

(c)

    APk = Q/K = 108.03 / 20 = 5.4

(d)

    100 = 4 X 10^3/4 X K^1/4
        = 4 X 5.62 X K^1/4 
        = 22.48 X K^1/4
    K^1/4 = 100/22.48 = 4.44

**Q6.** Suppose a production function is given as Q = A L^3/5 K^2/5 and A = 2. Prove that this
production function follows constant returns to scale using a numerical example.

**Ans:**

    A production function is said to follow constant returns to scale when output increases proportionately to an increase in inputs. Here we will give arbitrary values to labor and capital and find the output and later double both labor and capital. It could be concluded that the production function follows constant returns to scale if output also doubles.

    Lets assume that L =15 and K=15. Then,
    Q = 2 * 15^3/5 * 20^2/5
      = 2 * 5.07 * 3.31 
      = 33.6

    Now we will double both capital and labor. The production function becomes,
    Q = 2 * 30^3/5 * 40^2/5
      = 2 * 7.69 * 4.37 
      = 67.2 

    67.2/33.6 = 2

    Thus, it has been seen that doubling of inputs has resulted in doubling of output. Hence, the production function follows constant returns to scale.

## 8. COST OF PRODUCTION

Cost is the expenditure incurred y a firm in the
production of a commodity.

### Cost Concepts

**Explicit Cost:** it is the expenses actually met y
the producer while producing a commodity.
( Raw materials)

**Implicit Cost:** is the opportunity cost of the
factor services supplied by the firm itself.
(Rent)

**Accounting Costs** this is the monetary outlay for
producing a certain good. Accounting costs will include
your variable and fixed costs you have to pay.

**Sunk Cost** These are costs that have been incurred and
cannot be recouped. (Adv cost)

**Social Costs** This is the total cost to society. It includes private costs plus any external costs.

**Private cost** It is the cost incurred by the producer in the production of a good.

**External Cost** When a commodity is produced it may
cause damages to the environment in the form o fair
pollution, water pollution etc.

**Replacement cost** is the amount of money required to
replace an existing asset with an equally valued or
similar asset at the current market price.

## Types of Costs

### Short - run Costs

**1. TOTAL FIXED COST**
- It is the cost which does not vary with the level of output
- Ex : Rent of factory building, Salary of permanent employees, interest payment

![tfc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/f90e65c7-699a-4906-87ad-ce441d5a187b)


**2. TOTAL VARIABLE COST(TVC)**
- Variable cost is the cost that vary with the level of output
   - When output is zero, variable cost is also zero
   - When output increases, cost also increases
- Example : Cost of raw materials, wages of workers, transportation cost, fuel charges
  
![tvc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/e8490a37-8aee-4514-9742-92d3bfe5a2db)


**3. TOTAL COST(TC)**

      TC = TFC + TVC

      
![tc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/b5a5157a-ba5d-47ee-b44b-e399a6ed4111)


**4. Average Variable Cost (AVC)**

    AVC = TVC / Q

    TVC - total variable cost
    Q - Quantity

![avc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/5d5f4cc5-ecda-4f0d-8887-48668d05037d)


**5. Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**
      
    AFC = TFC / Q

    TFC - total fixed cost
    Q - quantity

![afc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/bd44c130-c810-4c22-9208-377e52e4d5c0)


**6. Average Cost(AC) or Average Total Cost(ATC)**

    AC = TC / Q
       = (TFC + TVC) /Q
       = AFC + AVC

![ac](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/2f845a31-fdd4-43db-a0e2-a21edc8629f0)


**7. Marginal Cost(MC)**

MC is the addition to total cost when one more unit of output Q is produced

    MC  = ΔTC / ΔQ
    MCn = TCn - TCn-1

![mc](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/6562583a-c034-489f-984c-eec989a982e9)


### Long - run Costs

**1. Long Run Average Cost (LAC)**
- LAC is derived from short run AC
- LAC is termed as the collection of SAC

**2. Long - run Marginal Cost**
- LMC is ‘U’ shaped curve
- LMC passes through the lowest point of LAC

[lac lmc]

## 
**NUMERICALS ON COST**

**Q1.** The total cost function of a firm is given as TC = 1000 + 10Q – 6Q^2 + Q^3

(a) Derive TVC,MC, AVC and AC

(b) What is TFC when output equals to 500 units?

(c) What is MC when output is 100 units?

**Ans:**

(a)

    TVC = TC - TFC
        = 10Q - 6Q^2 + Q^3

    MC = d(1000 + 10Q - 6Q^2 + Q^3)/ dQ
       = 10 - 12Q + 3Q^2

    AVC = TVC / Q
        = 10Q - 6Q^2 + Q^3 / Q
        = 10 - 6Q + Q^2

    AC = TC / Q
       = 1000 + 10Q - 6Q^2 + Q^3 / Q
       = 1000 / Q + 10 - 6Q + Q

(b)
 
    Total Fixed Cost (TFC) is the part of the total cost that does not vary with the level of output. 
        TFC = 1000

(c)

    MC = 10 - 2Q + 3Q^2
       = 10 - 12(100) + 3(100)^2
       = 10 - 1200 + 30000
       = 28810

**Q2.** Suppose in the short run AVC 4. Suppose in the short run
AVC<P<AC. Will this firm produce or shut down? Give reason.

**Ans:**

    The firm will produce because P (Selling Price) is greater than Average Variable Cost(AVC)

**Q3.** Total cost function of a firm is given as TC = 100 + 50Q − 11Q^2 + Q^3
Find the marginal cost when output equals 5 units.

**Ans:**

    Given Output Q = 5
    Given TC = 100 + 50Q − 11Q^2 + Q^3
  
    Marginal Cost = dTC / dq
                  = d(100 + 5Q - 11Q^2 + Q^3) / dQ
                  = 50 − 22Q + 3Q^2
    substitue   Q = 5 in the equation
               MC = 50 − 22 ∗ 5 + 3 ∗ 5^2
               MC = 15

##

## 9. Revenue

Revenue means receipts from sale of output by a
firm in a given period

**Total Revenue**

It is the total amount of money received by a firm from the sale of goods and services during a certain period

    TR = Q * P

    Q - Quantity
    P - Price

**Average Revenue**

    AR = TR / Q
       = P * Q / Q 
       = P

    AR = P

**Marginal Revenue**

      MR = TRn - TRn-1
         = d(TR) / dQ


## Shutdown and Breakeven Points

**Shutdown point**

MC is the addition to total cost when one more unit of output Q is produced

Suppose the price of a product is less than AC, It is still beneficial for the firm to continue
production till price is greater than AVC

price = AVC is the shutdown point of the firm

That is the minimum point of the AVC curve

![shutdown](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/aa39bde2-57bf-49c4-8df2-90fb9b722b76)



**Break even Analysis**

Break even analysis is a method that is used to analyse the relationship between total cos,
total revenue and profit of an organization at different levels of output

The most important aspect of break even analysis is identifying the break-even point.

Break even point is the point at which total revenue of a firm equals total cost

It is the point at which total revenue of a firm equals total cost

Its a point where there is no profit or loss for the firm

    BEP = TFC / PV Ratio
        = (TFC * S) / (S - V)

![breakeven](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/d24c2b08-7c5f-46ae-bbd2-5a2a57be2388)


**PV Ratio**

P/V ratio(Profit Volume Ratio) is the ratio of contribution to sales which indicates the
contribution earned with respect to one rupee of sales

    PV Ratio = Contribution / Sales

    Contribution = Sales - Variable Cost

**Margin of Safety**

Margin of safety is sales beyond break-even point. It is calculated as the difference
between total sales and break even sales

    Margin of safery = Sales - Break Even Sales

**NUMERICALS ON BREAKEVEN AND SHUTDOWN**

**Q1.** Suppose a firm pays Rs.10000 as monthly rent and Rs.10000 as
interest payment. Its monthly expenditure on raw materials is Rs.40000
and it get monthly sales revenue of Rs.80000. The price of one unit of
output is Rs.40. Estimate i) P/V Ratio ii) Break even sales iii) Break-even
output iv) Profit earned v) Margin of safety.


    P/V RATIO
      P/V Ratio = Contribution Margin ÷ Selling price per unit
      Contribution Margin=Total Sales−Variable Costs
      Given
          Total Sales = Rs 80,000
          Variable Costs = Expenditure on Raw Materials = Rs 40,000
          Contribution Margin=80,000−40,000 = 40,000
      P/V Ratio = 40000 / 80000 = 0.5

    BREAK EVEN SALES
      BEP = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit
      Contribution Margin per unit = Contribution Margin / Number of units sold
      Fixed cost = Rent + Interest = 10,000 + 10,000 = 20,000
      Contribution margin per unit = 40,000 / 80,000-40,000 = 1
      BEP = 20,000 / 1 = 20,000
      Break even sales = BEP / (P/V Ratio) = 20,000 / 0.5 = 40,000

    BREAK EVEN OUTPUT
      Break even output = Break even sales / price of one unit of output
      Given price of one unit of output = Rs 40
      Break even output = 40000 / 40 = 1000

    PROFIT EARNED
      Profit = Total Sales - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs)
      Total Sales = 80,000
      Fixed Costs = 20,000 (Interest + Rent)
      Variable cost = 40,000 (Raw material expenditure)

    MARGIN OF SAFETY
      Margin of safety = Profit / (P/V Ratio)
      Margin of safery = 20,000 / 0.5 = 40,000

**Q2.** Consider the following data of a company for the year 2022. Sales Rs.
80000, Fixed Cost is Rs. 15000, Variable cost is Rs. 35000. Find the
following (a) Breakeven Sales (b) Contribution (c) Margin of safety (d) Profit.

**Ans:**

    Sales = 80000, Fixed Cost = 15000, Variable cost = 35000.

    BREAK EVEN SALES
      Breakeven sales = Fixed Cost / Contribution Margin Ratio
      Contribution Margin = Sales - Variable Costs
      Contribution Margin = 80,000 - 35,000
      Contribution Margin = 45000
      Contribution margin Ratio = Contribution Margin / Sales
      Contribution Margin Ratio = 45000 / 80000 = 0.5625
      Breakeven Sales = 15000 / 0.5625 = 26666.67

    CONTRIBUTION
      Contribution = Sales - Variable Costs
      Contribution = 80,000 - 35,000
      Contribution = 45000

    MARGIN OF SAFETY
      Margin of safety = Actual Sales - Breakeven sales
                       = 80,000 - 26666.67
                       = 53333.37

    PROFIT
      Profit = Contribution - Fixed Cost
             = 45000 - 15000
      Profit = 30000
