# MODULE 5

## 1. INTERNATIONAL TRADE

International trade is the exchange of goods
and services between countries.

International trade is an exchange involving a
good or service conducted between at least
two different countries.

### Advantages of International Trade
1. International trade enables countries to specialize in the production of those
commodities in which they have a comparative advantage.
2. It increases the size of a firm’s market, resulting in lower average costs and higher
productivity.
3. International competition promotes innovative production, new technology and
marketing.
4. Consumers benefit in the domestic economy as they can now obtain a greater variety
of goods and services.
5. The increased competition ensures commodities are supplied at the lowest prices.
6. It results in foreign exchange gains. When India sells its products abroad, it receives
foreign currency. This money is then used to pay for imports that are produced more
cheaply overseas.
7. Free trade creates new jobs in the domestic economy. Employment will increase in
exporting industries.
8. The countries involved in free trade experience rising living standards, increased real
incomes and higher rates of economic growth. This is created by more competitive
industries, increased productivity, efficiency and production levels
9. Greater access to imports will benefit consumers and businesses by widening the
choice of products available and boosting the living standards of the people.
10. Having a bigger market to sell to means that a business can sell more, earn more
profits and pay higher wages. Exporting businesses pay more to workers and sell
more per worker than non-exporters.
11. In the absence of trade, governments may distort market prices by subsidizing
production. In such cases, production and trade, guided by distorted prices, will not be
efficient.
12. One clear cost of protection is that the country imposing it forces its consumers to
forgo cheap imports.

### Disadvantages of International Trade

1. The main argument for protectionism is the infant industry argument. Industries in
developing countries can effectively compete with those already developed if they
receive some initial protection in the form of tariffs or subsidies.
2. Increased economic stability as economies do not become dependent on global
markets. This means that businesses are not vulnerable to downturns in the
economies of their trading partners, e.g. Recession in the USA leads to decreased
demand for India’s exports, leading to falling export incomes, lower GDP, lower
incomes, lower domestic demand, and rising unemployment.
3. Countries with surplus products may dump them on world markets at prices below
the cost of production.
4. Countries whose economies are largely agricultural face unfavourable terms of
trade. Their export income is much smaller than the import payments they make for
high value imports resulting in large foreign debt levels.
5. All round industrial development will occur in the country since it cannot depend on
foreign industries.
6. Free trade can lead to pollution and other environmental problems as companies fail
to include these costs in the price of goods while trying to compete with companies
operating under weaker environmental legislation in some countries.
7. If old traditional industries are not protected, foreign competition may ruin them and
create unemployment.
8. It is unwise to export all the natural resources of a country. For example, India has
exhausted its large supply of manganese and mica in the name of earning foreign
exchange.
9. Protective import duties are a way to generate tax revenue.
10. During times of global financial crises and recession, falling employment has often
resulted in an increase in protectionist policies in many countries. Governments in
the United States, Britain and other European countries have faced domestic
pressure to stop purchases from Chinese and Indian companies.

### THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE

**1. Adam Smith’s Theory of Absolute Advantage**

- The concept of absolute advantage was
developed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations 
- Countries should specialize in producing the goods and services in which they have absolute advantage and engage in free trade with other countries to sell their goods.
- A country’s resources would therefore be utilized
in the best possible way—in the production of
goods and services in which the country has a
productivity advantage compared with other countries—and national wealth would be maximized.


**2. Comparative advantage theory of international trade**

- Comparative cost advantage theory was developed by David Ricardo
- Even in the case of a country for which there is no absolute advantage for both the
commodities, it can gain from international trade.
- In this situation, the country should specialize in the production and export of the
commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller and import the commodity in
which its absolute disadvantage is greater

 **Assumptions**
 1. There are only two countries and two commodities
2. There are no barriers in international trade
3. There is no transport cost
4. Labour is the only component of cost of production
5. There is perfect competition and full employment

|COUNTRY|No.of units of labour per unit of cloth| No.of units of labour per unit of Wine|Exchange Ratio|
|-|-|-|-|
|England|100|120|1 wine = 1.2 cloth|
|Portugal| 90|808|1 wine = 0.88 cloth|

- The above example shows portugal has an absolute advantage in the production of both
commodities
- Ratio of wine and cloth production shows that
  - Portugal has advantage in wine, so it will specialise in wine production and produce wine
  - England will similarly produce cloth

Let’s look at a simplified hypothetical example to illustrate the subtle difference between
these principles. Miranda is a Wall Street lawyer who charges $500 per hour for her legal
services. It turns out that Miranda can also type faster than the administrative assistants in her
office, who are paid $40 per hour. Even though Miranda clearly has the absolute advantage in
both skill sets, should she do both jobs? No. For every hour Miranda decides to type instead of
do legal work, she would be giving up $460 in income. Her productivity and income will be
highest if she specializes in the higher-paid legal services and hires the most qualified
administrative assistant, who can type fast, although a little slower than Miranda. By having both
Miranda and her assistant concentrate on their respective tasks, their overall productivity as a
team is higher. This is a comparative advantage. A person or a country will specialize in doing
what they do relatively better. In reality, the world economy is more complex and consists of
more than two countries and products. Barriers to trade may exist, and goods must be
transported, stored, and distributed. However, this simplistic example demonstrates the basis of
the comparative advantage theory

**3. Hekscher - Ohlin theory**

- The theory was originally developed y Eli Heckscher in 1919. Later in 1935 it was refined by Bertil Ohlin.
Hence it is known as Heckscher – Ohlin Theorem.
- Heckscher – Ohlin Theorem states that a country will
produce and export that commodity whose production
requires the intensive use of nation’s relatively
abundant and cheap factor and import the commodity
whose production requires the intense use of relatively
scare and expensive factor.
- In other words, relatively labor abundant country will
export the relatively labor-intensive commodity and
import the relatively capital – intensive commodity.

## 2. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

Balance of Payment is a systematic record of all economic transactions of a nation with the rest of the world for a specific period of tie. Usually, time period is taken as one year.

It is obvious that during a period of time millions of transactions take place between one nation and with the rest of the world. Therefore, all these transactions cannot appear individually in the balance of payment statement. As a summary statement, BoP aggregates all these transactions under different heads.

**1. Components of Current Account Transaction**

|Sl. no| Items| Details|
|-|-|-|
|1. |Visible trade items| It includes all types of physical goods that can be seen,touched, felt & measured - Import of goods: debit side - Export of goods: credit side|
|2.| Invisible trade items| It includes all types of services that can not be seen,touched, felt & measured. Eg. import and exports of services (insurance, banking, education) - Import of services: debit side - Export of services: credit side|
|3.| Unilateral transfers| It includes gifts, personal remittance, and donations. or we can say one way transactions i.e. nothing in return - Transfer payment- Debit side - Transfer receipt- credit side|
|4. |Income receipts and payments to and from abroad| It includes investment incomes and payments in the form of Rent, profit, interest It is generated through capital account transactions - Income payments: Debit - Income received: Credit|

**2. Components of Capital Account Transaction**

|Sl. no| Items| Details|
|-|-|-|
|1.|Borrowing and Lending from and to abroad| All transactions concerned with borrowing from abroad and lending to abroad are taken into consideration. Receipts of loan and Repayments of loan by foreigners- Credit side Lending to abroad and Repayment of loan to abroad- Debit side
|2.| Investments to and from abroad| All transactions of investment in shares, real estate etc in between resident and foreigners are taken into consideration. Investments from abroad-Credit side. Investment to abroad-Debit side
|3.|Change in foreign exchange reserves (FER)| FER are the financial assets (money, bonds, securities) of the government held by the central bank. Withdrawal from these assets-credit sides. Additions to these assets-debit sides

**3. Finanacial Account**

In the financial account, international monetary flows related to investment in
business, real estate, bonds, and stocks are documented. Also included are
government-owned assets such as foreign reserves, gold, special drawing rights held with
the International Monetary Fund, private assets held abroad, and direct foreign investment.
Assets owned by foreigners are also recorded in the financial account.

**4. Official Reserve Account**

It refers to the foreign currency held by the central bank of a country and is used to
balance the payments from year to year.

**5. Errors and Omissions**

Sometimes the balance of payments does not balance. It is due to errors that have
crept in during the compilation of the bop statement. Hence an entry called errors and
omissions is made to reflect this imperfection.

##
### Balance of Payments Deficit

A disequilibrium in the balance of payment
means its condition of Surplus Or deficit

A **Surplus** in the BOP occurs when Total
Receipts exceeds Total Payments. Thus,
**BOP= CREDIT>DEBIT**

A **Deficit** in the BOP occurs when Total
Payments exceeds Total Receipts. Thus,
**BOP= CREDIT<DEBIT**

**Reasons for disequilibrium in balance of payments**

1. **Economic Factors**

- The BOP will have deficits if the level of imports in a country is high.

- Lack of adequate international capital inflow into a country.

- External borrowings and loans from foreign countries.

- Rising petroleum prices have put a strain on the forex reserves of several countries.

- The quality of products of developing countries are not up to the world standards due to which they could not sustain foreign markets.

**2. Political Factors**

- Political instability in a country creates uncertainty among foreign investors which leads to a reduced inflow of foreign capital into the country.

- Disequilibrium in BOP also occurs in the event of fear of war with some other country.

**3. Structural Factors**

- The high degree of protection given to domestic industries leads to inefficiency and poor quality products. Hence exports suffer.

- In the case of India, the instability in the exchange value of the rupee was another
problem. This has created problems for both exporters and importers. Even though the
value of rupee was managed by the central bank, it was not able to maintain stability
since the currency was often affected by factors beyond the control of the RBI.

**4. Social Factors**

- Countries like India export mainly agriculture and agro based products. The price of
these have fluctuated heavily in the world markets.

- Indian agricultural exports were constantly affected by crop failures.

**5. Technological Factors**

- The lack of thrust in research and development has created a situation where countries
like India have very few products that foreigners find attractive.

- Excessive stress on technology intensive export-oriented industries by countries like
China has resulted in bop disequilibrium in countries like India.

##

### Correction in Disequilibrium or Deficit

When there is deficit in the balance of payments, it has to be corrected. The following are the important measures to correct a balance of payments disequilibrium.

**1. Automatic Correction**

When there is a disequilibrium in the balance of payments, the economy will try to correct it automatically with the help of demand supply mechanism. For example, when there is a deficit, or the demand for foreign exchange exceeds its supply, the exchange rate will get adjusted accordingly and there will be fall in the external value of the domestic currency. This will increase the exports and correct the deficit.


**2. Deliberate Measures**

   **2.1 Monetary Measures**

   ***(a) Monetary contraction or Expansion***

   Expansion or contraction of money supply can affect the balance of payments position. When there is a deficit, a contraction of money supply will decrease the purchasing power of the people and hence the aggregate demand as well as the price level falls. This reduces the imports. When there is a fall in the prices in the domestic economy, it encourages export. Thus, deficit will be corrected.

   ***(b) Devaluation***

   Devaluation occurs when a country
    intentionally reduces the value of its currency
    relative to one or more foreign countries. Devaluation occurs when a government
    wishes to increase its balance of trade
    (exports minus imports) by decreasing the relative value of its currency.

***(c) Exchange Control***
   
  Under exchange control, the government or the central bank will the complete control over the foreign exchange earnnig of the country. The government will kee the entire foreign exchange earnings and this helps the government to control imports.

**2.2 Trade Measures**

***(a) Export promotion***

Export can be encouraged by abolishing export duty, giving export subsidy and by providing facilities for export-oriented production

***(b) Import control***

Imports can be discouraged by increasing import duties, through import quotas import licensing etc.

**2.3. Miscellaneous Measures**

This includes encouragement os foreign incestments, promoting tourism etc.

##

### DEVALUATION

It is the lowering of the exchange value of the currency of a country. When a country
devalues its currency, exports becomes cheaper and imports become expensive which causes
a reduction in the BOP deficit.

As a result of reduction in the exchange rate of a currency with respect to foreign
currencies, the prices of goods to be exported fall, whereas prices of imports go up. This
encourages exports and discourages imports. With exports so stimulated and imports
discouraged, the deficit in the balance of payments will tend to be reduced.

***Objectives of Devaluation***
1. To boost exports. Imports become more expensive and exports become more
competitive and lucrative.
2. To encourage a greater quantity of export from the country whose currency is being devalued.
3. To reduce trade deficits. The increase in exports along with a reduction in imports will
cause a positive impact on the balance of trade.
4. To lower the cost of a country’s external debt.

***Condition for devaluation***

1. Success depends of reaction of other counties, if they retaliate by devaluing their
currencies, devaluation will not be successful
2. Depends on elasticities of demand for export
3. If prices in domestic country increases at the same rate or at a higher rate of devaluation.
It will not increase or decrease export

**ELASTIC DEMAND CURVE** : When demand for exports is more elastic, a fall in price of exports in terms of foreign currency increases the export earnings and there will be a favourable effect on balance of payments

**INELASTIC DEMAND CURVE** : When price elasticity of demand is less than one, there will be a decrease in export earnings due to devaluation

**ZERO ELASTIC** : Devaluation increases the price of the imports in terms of home currency

![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-10 at 10 04 37_b35e61c5](https://github.com/Namitha-KS/WikiSyllabus/assets/114816602/f763f1ce-c7d9-4584-bf4d-1aa03140899d)


**LESS ELASTIC** : When the value of elasticity of demand is greater than zero but less than one, there will be a decline in imports due to an increase in the price of imports. But it will not be substantial.

**MORE ELASTIC** : When the demand for imports is more elastic, an increase in price causes a substantial decrease in the volume of imports and hence it has larger impact on import bill as well as balance of payments

***LIMITATIONS OF DEVALUATION***

1. Devaluation is successful only when other countries do not retaliate the same. If both the
countries go for the same, the effect is nil.

2. Devaluation is successful only when the demand for exports and imports is elastic. In case it is
inelastic, it may make the situation worse.

3. Devaluation, though helps correct disequilibrium, is considered to be a weakness for the
country.

4. Devaluation may bring inflation in the following conditions :-
  
    - Devaluation brings the imports down, When imports are reduced, the domestic supply
of such goods must be increased to the same extent. If not, scarcity of such goods unleash
inflationary trends.

    - A growing country like India is capital thirsty. Due to non availability of capital goods
in India, we have no option but to continue imports at higher costs. This will force the industries
depending upon capital goods to push up their prices.

    - When demand for our exports rises, more and more goods produced in a country
would go for exports and thus creating a shortage of such goods at the domestic level. This
results in rising prices and inflation.

    - Devaluation may not be effective if the deficit arises due to cyclical or structural
changes.
##
**MARSHALL LERNER CONDITION**

Devaluation will improve the balance of payments of a country if sum elasticities of
demand for countries exports and its demand for imports is greater than one.

## 3. TRADE POLICY

Trade policy refers to the regulations and policies that state how a country carries out
international trade with other foreign countries. It is also referred to as commercial policy. It
consists of tariffs on imported goods, quotas, export constraints and restrictions on the
domestic operations of foreign companies. Subsidies may also be provided to domestic
industries to enable them to compete with foreign industries. 

The major 2
policies that the countries follow with respect
to international trade are
1. **Free Trade** (Free trade means free and
unfettered trade between countries)
2. **Protectionism** (Purposeful policy by a nation
to control imports while promoting exports.)

### FREE TRADE

Free trade occurs when there are no artificial barriers put in place by governments to
restrict the flow of goods and services between trading nations. When trade barriers, such as
tariffs and subsidies are put in place, they protect domestic producers from international
competition and redirect, rather than create trade flows.
Free trade is supported as the policy, which is most conducive to maximizing the
economic welfare of a given society. It is argued that free trade allows different economies to
make use of comparative advantages by the exchange of commodities. After the signing of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, per capita growth was at an all-time high while
tariffs were at a historically low level. People within a national economy will all be better off
if they specialize at what they do best instead of trying to be self-sufficient.

**Advantages of Free Trade**

1. Increased economic growth
2. More dynamic business climate
3. Improves Quality
4. Technology transfer
5. Expertise
6. More choice of goods
7. Foreign direct investment

**Disadvantages of Free Trade**

1. Threat to domestic industries
2. Destruction of native cultures
3. Degradation of natural resources
4. Poor working conditions

### PROTECTIONISM

It is the policy of protecting domestic industries by imposing high customs duties on
foreign products. Economic theory does not rule out protectionism as a welfare maximizing
policy option. Whether or not a particular economy warrants protection depends on whether it
will maximize the economic welfare of its populace. Historically, most economies developed
while significant tariffs were in place and high tariffs tended to coincide with relatively high
rates of per capita GDP growth.

##

### TRADE BARRIERS

A major component of trade policy are trade barriers consisting of tariffs and
non-tariff barriers.

### Tariff Barriers

When two countries trade in the goods, a
certain amount is charged as a fee by the
country, in which goods are entered, so as to
provide revenue to the government as well as
raise the price of foreign goods, so that the
domestic companies can easily compete with
the foreign items.

This fee is in the form of tax or duty, which is
called a tariff barrier.

### Non Tariff Barriers

Non-tariff barriers refer to non-tax measures
used by the country’s government to restrict
imports from foreign countries.

It covers those restrictions which lead to
prohibition, formalities or conditions, making
the import of goods difficult and decrease
market opportunities for foreign items.


| Basis                   | Tariff Barriers                                                                                     | Non-Tariff Barriers                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Meaning**             | Tariff Barriers are taxes or fees imposed by the government on imports to protect domestic industries and boost revenue for the government. | Non-tariff barriers include all limitations other than taxes imposed by the government on imports to protect domestic enterprises and discriminate against new entrants. |
| **Permissibility**      | The World Trade Organisation authorises its members to impose tariff barriers but only at reasonable rates.                            | Import quotas and voluntary export barriers were eliminated by the World Trade Organisation.                                              |
| **Nature**              | Tariff barriers are explicit in nature.                                                             | Non-tariff barriers are implicit in nature.                                                                                               |
| **Form**                | Tariff barriers are imposed in the form of Taxes and Duties.                                        | Non-tariff barriers are imposed in the form of Regulations, Conditions, Requirements, Formalities, etc.                                   |
| **Revenue**             | Tariff barriers generate revenue for the government.                                                | Non-tariff barriers do not generate revenue for the government.                                                                            |
| **Affects**             | Tariff barriers affect the price of imported goods.                                                 | Non-tariff barriers affect the quantity or price or both of the imported goods.                                                            |
| **Monopolistic Organizations** | As the government charges tariff barriers, monopolistic organizations’ prices can be controlled. | The monopolistic organization charges high rates for low output.                                                                           |
| **Profit**              | Profits made by the importers can be restricted through tariff barriers.                            | Importers can make high profits through non-tariff barriers.                                                                               |
| **Example**             | Import Duties, Export Duties, Ad-valorem Duties, etc.                                               | Import Licensing, Foreign Exchange Regulations, Import Quotas, etc.                                                                         |
