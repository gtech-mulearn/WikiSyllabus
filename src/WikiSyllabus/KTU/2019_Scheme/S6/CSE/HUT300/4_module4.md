## 1. CIRCULAR FLOW OF ECONOMICS

The circular flow of income and expenditure refers to the process whereby the national income
and expenditure of an economy flow in a circular manner continuously through time. The
various components of national income and expenditure such as saving, investment, taxation,
government expenditure, exports, imports, etc. 

The following are the 3 models:
1. Circular Flow in a Two Sector Economy
2. Circular Flow in a Three- Sector Economy
3. Circular Flow in a Four- Sector Economy

## 2. STOCK AND FLOW

**Stock is a quantity measurable at a particular point of time.** 

*A statement like a person earns 10000 rupees
is meaningless unless the time period is mentioned. The person may be earning it daily,
weekly, monthly or even annually which would then make a huge difference to his earning
capacity. Money is a concept that makes sense only when a time period is mentioned. It is
called as a flow because they occur in a period of time. A definite time period has to be
mentioned to get a quantitative measure of such concepts. Since a lot of accounting is done
annually in an economy, most of these variables are expressed annually.
E.g. money, income, output, profits etc.*

**Flow is a quantity measured over a period of time E.g. annual salary of an individual.**

*Capital goods or consumer durables
once produced do not wear out or get consumed in a specific time period. In fact capital
goods continue to serve through different cycles of production. The buildings or machines in
a factory are there irrespective of the time period. There can be addition to the stock when a
new machine is added. There can be a deduction from the stock when a machine is damaged
and is not replaced.
E.g. buildings, machines, vehicles, computers, furniture etc.*


|STOCK|FLOW|

|Point of Time|Over a period of Time
|No time dimension|Involves time dimension
|Static concept|Dynamic concept

## 3. FINAL GOODS AND INTERNMEDIARY GOODS

**FINAL GOODS**

Goods which are sold to consumers for their own use and not used as a means for
further production are final goods. They do not need further processing since they are
finished products. 

They are also called as consumer goods. 

They are classified into durable
goods, non-durable goods and services.

E.g. cars, mobiles, shoes, refrigerators etc.

**INTERMEDIARY GOODS**

Goods which are used in the production of other goods are intermediate goods. It is a
product used to produce a final good. 

Intermediate goods are sold between industries for
resale or for the production of other goods. 

These goods need further processing since they
are semi-finished products. 

They are used as inputs to become part of the finished product.

They are not taken into consideration during the estimation of national income since their
value is included final goods.

E.g. raw materials like steel, copper, rubber, coal etc.

## 4. NATINAL INCOME CONCEPTS

**1. Gross National Product**

GNP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a year. 

It is
the basic social accounting measure.

    GNP = Consumption + Government spending + Domestic Investment + Net Foreign Investment

    GNP = C + I + G + X - M


It only includes the market value of final goods and ignores transactions involving intermediate goods. 

These are the goods purchased for final use and not for resale or further
processing. 

While calculating GNP, all non-productive transactions have to be excluded.

##

**2. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT**

GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within the
domestic territory of a country in a year.
    
    GDP = GNP – Net Factor Income From Abroad (NFIFA)

##

**3. NET NATIONAL PRODUCT**

It is the market value of all final goods and services after allowing for depreciation.

    NNP = GNP - Depreciation

NNP is also referred to as national income as market prices. 

NNP is a better than GNP since
it makes allowances for the depreciation of machinery, equipment, buildings and the like.

##

**4. DEPRECITION**

Depreciation is the fall in the value of capital goods like machinery as a result of wear
and tear. It is an annual allowance for wear and tear of a capital good. It is the cost of the
good divided by number of years of its useful life.

##

**5. NET DOMESTIC PRODUCT**

    NDP = GDP - Depreciation

##

**6. NATIONAL INCOME**

The entire NNP does not reach the people. The manufacturers have to pay indirect
taxes to the government. Thus, this part of total income will not be available to the people.

The government may also give subsidies on the production of certain goods like kerosene and
ration rice. Hence, these goods are sold at lower prices since the government bears a part of
the price in the form of a subsidy for these products. 

Therefore, to arrive at the correct
estimate of National it is necessary to subtract indirect taxes and add subsidies to NNP.

This is the actual national income of a country. It is also referred to as National
Income at factor cost.

    NI (NI at factor cost) = NNP - indirect taxes + subsidies

    NI at market Prices = NNP + indirect taxes – subsidies
##

**7. PERSONAL INCOME**

It is the sum total of income actually received by all individuals in a country during a
given year.
    
    PI = NI - social security contributions - corporate income taxes - undistributed Corporate profits + transfer payments

Transfer payments refer to unemployment allowances, old age pension etc.

##

**8. DISPOSABLE PERSONAL INCOME**

    DPI = PI - Direct taxes

##

**9. PER CAPITA INCOME**

It is the average income per head in the country. It is a rough indicator of the standard
of living of the people in a country.

    PCI = NI ∕ Population

##

**10. Market price & Factor cost**

Market price is the price paid by the buyer of a
commodity in the market

    MP = Cost of production + Indirect taxes – Subsidies
Factor cost is the cost paid by the producer to the
factor of production for their contribution in the
production of commodity

    FC = Cost of production - Indirect taxes + Subsidies

##

## 5. METHODS OF MEASURING NATIONAL INCOME

**1. PRODUCT METHOD/ OUTPUT METHOD**

GDP is estimated as sum of money value of all final goods and services produced in the
domestic territory of a country during a financial year

**2. FINAL EXPENDITURE METHOD**

    NI = C + I + G + ( X – M )

    NI - National Income
    C - Consumption expenditure
    I - Investment expenditure
    G - Government Expenditure
    X - Exports
    M - Imports

This method estimate GDP by adding the final expenditures in the economy
 - Private final consumption expenditure(C) - This is mainly the household expenditure
on final goods and services to satisfy their wants
 - Investment Expenditure
    - Expenditure for aquiring capital assets
- Government consumption expenditure
    - Government spends money for purchase of consumer goods like stationary
petrol etc
- Net exports
    - Foreigners spend money for goods(export) and we purchase foreign
goods(Import) , difference between these two is net foreign expenditure

**3. INCOME METHOD**

    NI = Rent + Wage + Interest + Profit

    Domestic Factor Income + NFIA = NI
- Income method takes the sum of the factor incomes in the economy
- Factor incomes are
    - Rent
        - Income earned by the people who supply land and building
    - Interest
        - It is the reward of capital. When money is borrowed for investment interest is
paid as the reward.
    - Wages
        - Reward of those who supply labour power
    - Profit
        - Reward of entrepreneur
    - Mixed income of self employed

## 6. THREE SECTORS OF ECONOMY

1. **Primary Sector:** This sector deals with the extraction and harvesting of natural resources
such as agriculture and mining.

2. **Secondary Sector:** This sector comprises construction, manufacturing, and processing.

3. **Tertiary Sector:** Retailers, entertainment, and financial companies make up this sector

##

## 7. INFLATION

It is the persistent increase in general price level or persistent decline in the real income of the people

It means as the price rises, the value of money declines

“Too much money chasing too few goods”

Inflation occurs due to an imbalance in demand and supply of money

**Types of Inflation**

1. ***Demand pull inflation:*** It happens when an increase in aggregate demand in the absence
of an increase in aggregate supply or a relatively less increase in aggregate supply.

2. ***Cost push inflation:*** It is the result of increase in cost of production. As the cost of
production increases, the supply decreases and the prices go up.

3. ***Creeping inflation*** > 0 – 3 %

4. ***Walking inflation*** > 3 – 10 %

5. ***Galloping inflation*** > More than 10%

6. ***Hyper inflation*** > More than 50%
Causes of Inflation


**Causes of inflation**

Causes of Inflation has been classified into two: Demand side factors and Supply side
factors

|Demand Side Factors|Supply Side Factors|
|-|-|
|Increase in money supply|Shortage in factors of production
|Increase in disposable income| Industrial dispute
|Increase in consumer spending|Natural calamities
|Black money|Artificial scarcity (Hoarding)
|Increase in exports|International factors
|Cheap monetary policy

## 8. METHODS TO CONTROL INFLATION

### 1. Monetary Policy Measures

Monetary policy measures are strategies implemented by the central bank of a country (e.g., the Reserve Bank of India, RBI) to regulate credit and money supply in the economy. These measures can be categorized as follows:

### a) Quantitative Credit Control Methods

Quantitative control aims to regulate the overall volume of bank credit without considering the specific purposes for which the credit is used. Key measures include:

#### i) Bank Rate

The bank rate, also known as the discount rate, is the minimum rate at which the central bank provides loans to commercial banks by rediscounting bills of exchange. When the central bank raises the bank rate, commercial banks increase their lending rates, resulting in reduced borrowing and a decrease in the money supply. As of January 2022, the bank rate in India is 6.25%.

#### ii) Reserve Ratio (CRR/SLR)

Depending on economic conditions, the central bank adjusts the reserves that commercial banks must maintain. There are two types of reserve ratios:

- **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):** Commercial banks are required to maintain an average cash balance with the RBI, which must be a certain percentage of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL). An increase in the CRR leads to credit contraction, while a decrease leads to credit expansion, allowing banks to provide more loans. The CRR in India legally ranges from 3-15%, with the current rate at 4%.

- **Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):** This is the percentage of reserves that commercial banks in India must maintain in the form of gold and government-approved securities before extending credit. An increase in the SLR results in credit contraction, whereas a decrease allows for credit expansion. The legal SLR range is 20-40%, with the current rate at 18.00%.

#### iii) Open Market Operations

This involves the central bank's purchase and sale of securities. Selling securities contracts credit, while purchasing them expands credit. Two important rates in this context are:

- **Repo Rate:** The rate at which the RBI lends money to banks for the short term. An increase in the repo rate contracts credit as banks borrow funds from the RBI at higher interest rates.
  
- **Reverse Repo Rate:** The short-term borrowing rate at which the RBI borrows money from banks. An increase in the reverse repo rate also contracts credit as banks prefer to deposit their funds with the RBI to earn higher interest. The current repo rate is 4.00%, and the reverse repo rate is 3.35%.

### 2. Fiscal Policy Measures

Fiscal policy measures are actions taken by the government to control aggregate demand in the economy. The main instruments of fiscal policy include:

### i) Public Revenue

The primary source of public revenue is taxation. To reduce total spending during inflation, the government increases taxes. Higher direct taxes reduce people's disposable income, leading to lower spending.

### ii) Public Expenditure

During inflation, the government cuts down its expenditure on developmental activities and welfare programs, reducing both government demand for goods and services and private income. When the government spends less, individual incomes decrease, leading to a reduction in aggregate demand.

### iii) Public Borrowing

During inflation, the government delays the repayment of public debt and borrows more from the public to reduce the money supply in the economy.

## 9. BUSINESS FINANCING


Business finance refers to funds availed by
business owners to meet their needs that
may include commencing a business,
obtaining top-up funds to finance business
operations, obtaining finance to purchase
capital assets for the business, or to deal with
a sudden cash crunch faced by the business.

**Sources of Capital**

1. Internal self – finance
2. Public Deposits
3. Loans from Bank
4. Indigenous Bankers
5. Development finance institutions

### Bonds and Shares

A bond is a fixed-income instrument that
represents a loan made by an investor to a
borrower (typically corporate or
governmental).

A share represents a unit of equity ownership
in a company. Shareholders are entitled to any
profits that the company may earn in the form
of dividends.
