# Flow of Constructor

```java
class Test
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Employee e1 = new Employee();
        Employee e2 = new Employee("John",10,15,100.40);
    }
}

class Person
{
    private String name;
    private int age;
    public Person()
    {
        System.out.println("Inside Parent Default");
        name = null;
        age = 0;
    }
    
    public Person(String name, int age)
    {
        System.out.println("Inside Parent Paramerized");
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person
{
    private int empId;
    private double salary;
    public Employee()
    {
        System.out.println("Inside Child Default");
        empId = 0;
        salary = 0;
    }
    
    public Employee(String name, int age, int empId, double Salary)
    {
        // super(name, age);
        System.out.println("Inside Child Parametrized");
        this.empId = empId;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

## Execution of Object e1

In this case, the system automatically generates an invoke call the parent class's default constructor. Note: The system can only call the default constructor by its own. For calling/executing the parameterized constructor of the parent.
super() is needed.

## Execution of Object e2

### Case 1

In the first case when the obj e2 is executed, the control goes to the parameterized constructor of the derived class and sees the user defined super keyword with parameters which executes the parameterized constructor of the
parent class

### Case 2

In the second case, when the object e2 is executed the control goes to the parameterized constructor of the derived class and the super() is generated by the complier, which executes the default constructor of the parent class
